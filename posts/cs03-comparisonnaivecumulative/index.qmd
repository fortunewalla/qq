**Objective:**

Comparing error metrics by switching naïve model to cumulative model.

**Introduction:**

You have been hired by General Miles, a company that produces healthy
gluten‐free breakfast cereal bars. The last market introduction happened a year
ago and your manager thinks there might be an issue in the forecasting
methodology. They are currently using a simple Naive forecasting model and you
think there might be some room for improvement.

Your boss provides you with the sales for the last 12 months and the forecasts
for the last 11 months. No data is available to forecast the first month as the
product was totally new to the market at the time.

**Comparison of Model Error Metrics**

| **Error Metric**  | **RMSE**  | **MAPE**  |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Naïve Model       | 80.45665  | 0.155729  |
| Cumulative Model  | 131.226   | 0.269029  |

**Conclusion:**

The cumulative model in this case is worse than the Naïve model since the RMSE
and the MAPE values are greater. It does not react quickly enough to adapt to
the high variability in sales for this new gluten free cereal bar.
