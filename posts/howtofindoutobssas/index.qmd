If one is in a situation where they have to know the number of observations in a particular SAS data set or use it for further calculations, SAS allows many ways of doing so. Let us look at a few quick ways using the DATA step. SAS documentation also includes a SAS Macro approach which will not be replicated here.

**Method 1:** The most straightforward way is to load the set in a `_null_` DATA step.
```
 data _null_;
 set dataset3obs;
 run;
```
The output is given by
```
 NOTE: There were 3 observations read from the data set WORK.DATASET3OBS.
 NOTE: DATA statement used (Total process time):
 real time 0.00 seconds
 cpu time 0.00 seconds
```
**Method 2:** Another way to extract & print is to output the `NOBS=` value, but since the DATA step loops to read all observations, the put statement is executed at every iteration.
```
 data _null_;
 set dataset3obs nobs=nobs;
 put nobs;
 run;
```
The output is given by
```

 NOTE: There were 3 observations read from the data set WORK.DATASET3OBS.
 NOTE: DATA statement used (Total process time):
 real time 0.00 seconds
 cpu time 0.00 seconds
```
**Method 3:** One way to overcome this & print a single value is to output the number of observations either at the beginning or at the end of DATA step.
```
 data _null_;
 set dataset3obs nobs=nobs;
 if _n_=1 then put nobs;
 run;
```
The output is given by
```

 NOTE: There were 3 observations read from the data set WORK.DATASET3OBS.
 NOTE: DATA statement used (Total process time):
 real time 0.00 seconds
 cpu time 0.00 seconds
```
**Method 4:** Output at the end of the data loop.
```
 data _null_;
 set dataset3obs nobs=nobs end=last;
 if last then put nobs;
 run;
```
The output is given by
```

 NOTE: There were 3 observations read from the data set WORK.DATASET3OBS.
 NOTE: DATA statement used (Total process time):

 cpu time 0.00 seconds
```
**Method 5:** One can even extract the value before the SET statement, as SAS loads it in the descriptor portion during the compilation phase.
```
 data _null_;
 set dataset3obs nobs=nobs;
 if _n_=1 then put nobs;
 run;
```
The output is given by
```

```
There are many other methods but these are simple for just a quick lookup.
