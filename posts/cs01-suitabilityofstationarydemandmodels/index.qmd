# Objective 

Study the suitability of stationary demand models for forecasting sales at the
Shah Alam Palm Oil Company.

# Introduction

Palm oil is harvested from the fruit of oil palm trees and is widely used as a
cooking oil throughout Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of Brazil. It is
becoming widely used throughout the world as it is a lower cost alternative to
other vegetable oils and has other attractive properties.

The Shah Alam Palm Oil Company (SAPOC) harvests, processes, and sells palm oil
throughout the region. As a demand analyst, you are asked to review the sales
volume (in pounds) of you premium palm oil by one of your customers, a local
grocery store in the region.

# Visualization of the raw data

**Q1. What is the trend over the last three years?**

There appears to be a positive trend. From the graph there is an increase in the
demand of palm oil by about 24 lbs per month for the last three years.

**Q2. Does there appear to be any seasonality in the demand pattern?**

Yes. If we plot the data by the months for each of the years, there seems to be
seasonality to the demand. Demand is low from January to May. It picks up from
June to August and then again from October to December.

**Q3. What is the forecast for demand in January 2015?**

| **Method**               | **Forecast for Jan 2015 (lbs)**  | **Actual value in Dec 2014**  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Naïve Model              | 1512                             | 1512                          |
| Cumulative Model         | 957.9444                         | 1512                          |
| 12 Period Moving Average | 1173.667                         | 1512                          |

**Q4. What is the root mean square error (RMSE) for a next period forecast for
these three years of demand?**

| **Method**               | **RMSE**  |   |
|--------------------------|-----------|---|
| Naïve Model              | 383.7282  |   |
| Cumulative               | 419.8851  |   |
| 12 Period Moving Average | 423.33    |   |

**Q5. Which of these three models is most appropriate for forecasting the
January 2015 demand?**

None. As shown above, the palm oil data shows a positive trend & seasonality
during the years. The Naïve model forecast for Jan 2015 is clearly different from the previous trends.
While the cumulative & naïve models are quite calm indicating they are
forecasting demand closer to the average of the data. The main reason for this
discrepancies is that the above three models assume a stationary demand that is
very close to the level of the mean.
