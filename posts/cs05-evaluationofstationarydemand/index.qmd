**Objective**

Select a suitable model among the given choices.

# Introduction 

TrainMax is a manufacturer of high‐end specialty engine equipment for high speed
trains. They produce parts that are sent to the original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs) for manufacturing new engines. They face a continuing challenge of trying
to forecast demand for their products. The demand for one part in particular,
XC‐288, was highlighted as needing to be examined.

## Check for stationary demand 

One way of doing is to determine the coefficient of variation (CV)

$$
CV=\frac{STDEV(data)}{AVERAGE(data)}
$$

We get

| STDEV   | 62.6899312 |
|---------|------------|
| AVERAGE | 1103.78571 |
| CV      | 0.05679538 |

CV is very low & hence the demand is quite stationary & stable in nature.

## Calculations among the models 

|                 | **Prediction for period 15**  | **MAPE(%)**  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Period 14 value | 1169                          |              |
| Naïve           | 1169                          | 7.08446274   |
| Cumulative      | 1103.78571                    | 5.13422811   |
| 2MA             | 1145                          | 6.46420824   |
| 4MA             | 1113.25                       | 4.79251584   |

Here we see that the moving average forecasts need not always be between the
naïve & cumulative forecasts.

## Selection of the model in the presence of a trend 

![](fig2.jpg)

If we assume there is a positive trend in the data then none of these models are
appropriate for demand with a trend pattern. The Cumulative, Naive, and Moving
Average forecasts all assume stationary demand. That means that you only assume
a Level pattern to the demand with some random noise.
