It is a condensed version of the full course & hence is the best option for those that cannot afford the full course. Use it with the Base SAS software available at your academic institution or company & practice all the example code. You can also buy access to SAS OnDemand to use SAS software through the Internet to practice for the exam.

**Option 3:** Join an institute that offer training in SAS & statistical analysis. They usually frame their SAS course syllabus & material from the official courses & have computer labs with access to Base SAS software. The advantage here is having an instructor who can give you feedback on your progress & clear your doubts & queries regarding the exam.

*Preparation:* You can be ready with 4-5 months of preparation if you follow any of the above options. Modifying existing code & using different procedures / keywords to achieve the same result is best way to understand how SAS works. It requires time & practice as SAS software is vast & comprehensive.

SAS Institute also offers a practice exam that you can purchase to test yourself before attempting the actual exam.

It should be understood that in addition to all this, there is an abundant amount of material on the Web to help you learn Base SAS programming & prepare for the certification credential exam. All the best!
