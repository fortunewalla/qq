## Introduction 

The demand data for a product has been shown in the table below. Compare the
forecasts using a

Moving Average with a period of 5 months, MA(5), and an Exponential smoothing
Method with an α of

0.33. For Exponential Smoothing use the midpoint of first 5 month range of the
average as the initial Forecast. (Hint: the Exponential Smoothing Forecast will
be initialized with a forecast of 4951 for April made in March.)

### Forecasting with 5­point moving average & simple exponential smoothing 

Here we use α=1/3 for our exponential smoothing model

### Accuracy of the models 

To estimate the accuracy of the models, we first compare the Mean Absolute
Deviation (MAD) for each of the models.

|     | **5MA**  | **SES**  |
|-----|----------|----------|
| MAD | 453.7429 | 432.0553 |

Also comparing the error cumulatively gives a better picture of the accuracy of
each of the models.

### Conclusion 

For this particular product, the forecasts from June to December show that SES
is performing better than 5MA. SES outperforms 5MA for 5 months while 5MA
outperforms SES for only 2 months.
