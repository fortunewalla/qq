## Introduction 

The demand data for a product has been shown in the table below. Compare the forecasts using a Moving Average with a period of 5 months, MA(5), and an Exponential smoothing Method with an α of 0.33. For Exponential Smoothing use the midpoint of first 5 month range of the average as the initial Forecast. (Hint: the Exponential Smoothing Forecast will be initialized with a forecast of 4951 for April made in March.)

### Forecasting with 5-point moving average & simple exponential smoothing 

Here we use α=1/3 for our exponential smoothing model

### Accuracy of the models 

To estimate the accuracy of the models, we first compare the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for each of the models.

|     | **5MA**  | **SES**  |
|-----|----------|----------|
| MAD | 453.7429 | 432.0553 |

Also comparing the error cumulatively gives a better picture of the accuracy of each of the models.

### Conclusion 

For this particular product, the forecasts from June to December show that SES is performing better than 5MA. SES outperforms 5MA for 5 months while 5MA outperforms SES for only 2 months.
