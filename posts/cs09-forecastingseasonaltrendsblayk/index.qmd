**Objective**

# Introduction 

You are the lead demand planner for Beers Looking At You, Kid (or BLAYK) a
restaurant that features sandwiches, appetizers, and, of course, beer. The
restaurant is known for its very fresh beer so the management tries to monitor
beer consumption by each shift. You have been tasked to look at how the beer
consumption is being forecasted in order to improve the quality and lower the
costs of having fresh beer.

There are four shifts in each day the restaurant is open:

Shift 1from 11 AM to 2 PM

Shift 2from 2 PM to 5 PM

Shift 3from 5 PM to 8 PM

Shift 4from 8 PM to 11 PM

The fields in the spreadsheet are:

Time Period (t) – a sequential numbering of each shift in your data from 1 to
120

Date – the date of the record

Shift Number – the shift number for that record (1, 2, 3, or 4), and

Pints Sold – the number of pints of beer sold on that day during that shift.

# Visualization of the raw data

## Initial Seasonality Factors 

The above diagram clearly points to a seasonality of the sales.

Since at this point it is not very clear as to whether there is a trend in the
data or not, we find use two methods to find the seasonality factors.

### Assuming no trend 

With no trend the seasonality factors (SF) need not be normalized each season.

>   SF per period = total sales per shift / (total sales per month/no. of
>   periods)

Also

>   SF per period = total sales per shift / average no. of sales per period

Mathematically we can express it as

∑ D t i

∑ D /P

### Centered Moving Average Method (CMA) 

Since each season has 4 periods, we use 4‐point Centered Moving Average. Here
since the season has an even number of points. We need to take the moving
average of the season from both sides & then take the final average.

Below is a sample of the data used to calculate part of the Fi’s

MATop is the average of Shift 1,2,3 & 4

MABottom is the average of Shift 2,3,4 & 5

MA_Avgi is the average of MATop & MABottom.

Each Fi is the xi/MA_Avgi except the first two & last two of the time series.
The first two & last two Fi are calculated by first & the last MA_Avg values
respectively.

| 3 | 1‐Jun | 3 | 242 | 260 | 264 | 262 |   | 0.924546 |   |   |   |
| 4 | 1‐Jun | 4 | 391 | 264 | 264 | 264 |   | 1.481762 |   |   |   |
| 5 | 2‐Jun | 1 | 373 | 264 | 264 | 264 |   | 1.41221  |   |   |   |

| 8 | 2‐Jun | 4 | 408 | 269 | 269 | 269 |   | 1.518846 |   |   |   |

Now if the assumption is incorrect & then is a small trend, then the sum of the
factors will not add up to number of periods in a season. i.e P = 4 Hence a
correction is required in the form and we simply multiply each of your
Seasonality Factors by

>   P

>   ∑

Once all the Fi are calculated, we average them according to Shift Number. The
summary is in the table.

## Holt­Winter Model (level+seasonality+trend) 

**Level & Trend:**

Running a linear regression we get the equation. y = 0.812x + 262.6

From the regression equation we get a level of about 263 pints of beer per shift
with an trend of 0.8 additional pints per time period. i.e.

The regression gives you an estimated level of 265 pints per each shift with a
trend of 0.80 additional pints per time period. This means that the sales of
beer is increasing about 3.2 pints per day. Hence there is a positive trend
trend.

### Seasonality 

This involves estimating the initial values of the level and trend
“de‐seasoning” the actual demand by the Seasonality Factors we just found. Part
of the data used to calculate the normalized seasonality factors.

| Gamma  | 0.05        |                      |

Using just the 122 forecast, the rest of the periods i.e. 123, 124 & 125 can be
calculated using

## Conclusion 

As observed above, the data about beer consumption follows seasonality & has a
positive trend. This can be modeled using the Holt‐Winter Model. Of course,
error analysis must be done to tweak the model especially the seasonality
factors.
