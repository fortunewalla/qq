Focusing on Customer Outcomes as Product Managers

SErvice Delivery: within healthcare, social work, govt. nhs digital, nhsx. Head of growth ~ Oversee marketing and sales team. Come from product & delivery background. Lot of that 

Q: How you transitioned into a product facing role?
A: Digital marketing and studied business in marketing. Worked in sales and marketing role. SEO for a couple of years. Delivering and implementation. Analytics, SEO. Marketing role for end to end. 
Product ownership & lead. Previous project experience. Started agile, product ownership, lean delivery, service designers, business analysts. Iteratively build User oreitend products. 

5 years. CX consultancy for a bit. Traditional groups and chatbots, conversational AI. Ended up at Diferent. Back in service delivery during covid.

Q: What was it like when covid hit? delivery/service.
A: Mar 2020 ~ Adapting to new situation. Remote. New Castle to working from home. Made changes pre-emptively. Got call from NHSX. 4 work streams. product ownership, delivery background. First time doing it. Took ownership. Got assigned to corona testing service. "client test ordering service in 7 days" from scratch. Primary outcome: Enable key workers to return to service from isolation. 40% were isolated without confirmed symptoms.

Enable people from home to order test kits while isolating. Need not be the workers but other members of their households.

Q: 7  days cannot do the usual Pm cycles and validation, so how did you go so quickly from outcomes to implementation?
A:  Day 1: Home test ordering service. Generic requirements. No outcome based service. Product ownership/delivery management. Analytics. Service Designer/UX. Technical architect/tight deadline oriented. Divided into 3 parts. 50 stakeholder interviews back-to-back on day 1. Labs, test kits, amazon logistics, warehousing, courier companies, govt. organisation, other agencies for testing. Very tired end of day. Pooled together insights. Started creating service blueprints and then a user journey. Assumptions of a service worker and testkits. Able to identify Vision, Goals & Objectives at a personal level as well as macro. Also got understanding what was pending and what was implemented. 

Identified from info first day, that if we bootstrapped from existing stuff and make a MVP end-to-end product, then what would it look like? Different stakeholders from end to end points.

Gaps in information at different points. Key Point:::: After we put together a blueprint, we set what our actual outcome would be to measure success against. "Enable key workers to return to service from isolation following proper negative results."

2nd Day: Put together an MVP, to enable people to go online and place an order, and get a test kit. Work closely with AWS as a build partner. Team with AWS engineers as new to them. Bunch of AWS developers to help out.  Using IaaS to build the MVP. Scalable. Using best practices. Best use of APIS.

3rd/4th day: Began building based on assumptions. Designs & service design assumptions.

5th day: test end to end process. Anti-Service design. Empty Box test. Using empty boxes to delivered.

Senior stakeholders to give demo of what was achieved. 

6th - 8th day: Getting whole thing into live environment. Getting the branding to the app. Official domain environment. By end of day 8., it was live. London service staff were teh first.

Also considered users with accessibility needs & non-digital needs.

On 3rd day: SOP for call centers. I was the call center. I added my phone and scripts . Mobile service as a call center to order as well as digital.

Again did diary studies and retrospective user research and analytics. Assumptions and continuous user research and iterative based on feedback.

1month after inception: ready for public release. Seeing analytics going nuts. All the dashboards were ready on live launch. Soft launch.

The service stood up. Asked to launch all over UK. So 2 weeks after public release, it was adapted for full UK launch. 

In 3 months, about 1M kits went out.

Q: Govt. & regulatory frameworks? How did it affect in medical sector? Was it downgraded for this situation? What do you think enabled this success?  Scaling to a week. Factors for success to move quickly??

A: 1.Everyone's buy-in needs a burning platform. Everyone wants to do their best. To reduce pressure to support the national effort. Everyone's mindset. motivated.

Early one, put a narrative around the outcome. Actual impact of delivering the service. 40% of staff was in isolation. My mum could see 20 patients. Now in isolation, she cannot treat them and being stuck at home would impact everything.

2.Focussing on the outcome and putting a good narrative on it. 3.Client was open minded. Since only 7 days, they can resolve blockers from stakeholders very fast.

Not perfect, but it works. Delivered something everyday either front-end or back-end.

Q. What is the knock on effect if we don't do this? What is the impact if we don't build this software?  Software improves human life. Would that perspective. Internalize.

A: Necessity is the mother of all invention. Identify what the need is. Human impact of the need. situational context of the services. 100% getting everyone aligned to what is it that we are collaboratively trying to get done. Good to be outcome focussed. Organized. Too many silos ~ Marketing, Sales, Tech. Lanes don't work. Need to be collaborative. Bring skills and experience to the table. 

Q: Big takeways you accomplished from Diferent
A: Key thing is measuring success. Are you going to utilize the vision you set to achieve. User research. Small samples. Or survey samples and deducing from it. Certain user trait or user behaviour from small data vs. using Analytics to see overall behaviour.

Assumption that people will order all available stock vs. looking at data and deducing that it is not true and that only a few people will order all available stock.

Data and analytics ~ Companies don't utilize their call centers enough. We modified to hourly and daily meetings. Feedback from calls about troubleshooting on apps, services, tech issues. 

Whole practice of CX design. Contact channels, user center design, customer feedback. 

Needs, painpoints, journeys ~ operate whole company around this.

Q: Any thoughts to aspiring PMs?
A: Look into various ways to engage stakeholders. Key thing is to set Vision, roadmaps to get people to buy-in to these things. Lot of different techniquest. Wardly mapping. 7 questions. Used by management consultants. 

Build buy-in from all the stakeholders. 
Utilize data to prove ROI.

Rest of it is simple.

"Partnering with Product Marketing"

Jacobs Creative

Abby Senior PMM ~ Ideal partnership between PMM & PM.

Get Response ~ Email Marketing Providers. This product is for Marketers for everything.  Landing pages. Webinars for tutorials & training. 

Answering customer queries.

Q: How you got into Product Marketing?
A: Making marketing tools marketable. Getting to know a product inside out. Really personal contact. Now chat and automated chatbots. Before it was phonecall. PM seed grew of talking to customers and get feedback and increase impact & influence in career growth.
PMM was getting a buzz.  Weave between disparate departments. Clear paths for growth and innovation.

Internal recruitment is a good way that getresponse helps employees grow. 

Hire and promote from within. Cultural benefit from growing internally. Culture is good and because growth and expanding skillsets and helps company to grow.

Q: PMM is product focus & customer focussed. But for orgs. starting out in PMM & overlap in product & marketing.
A: PMM connects all of the dots and come together for growth. Customer buys from you, stays with you & recommends you to others. PIRATE metrics. AARRG. i.e. Growth metrics to grow the business. We need happy customers for this & product that meets needs. PMM are primed in this level & product teams. connecting customer facing teams. and PMs and devs.

Customer Facing team --> PMM <-- PM <-- Devs. Strategic relationships 

Q: PMM is just a role for one product. Marketing is supposed to market it. Things are more siloed. Who is the customer? what problem are we trying to solve? and how do we package that? Demand gen team & sales team can actualy use that information in what they are trying to . 

A: PMs think they have all the documentation but PMM cannot market it because they don't know what it is. A developer was documenting what they did in that week's sprint but it doesn't fill a need. PMM fills a need that the dev's docs and the PM docs doesn't fill in.

Q: Role of PMM & PM with GetResponse and in an ideal situation.
A: Huge enterprises has PMMs and were sharing the same pain points as small startups/early stage.

In GetResponse, we set biweekly sessions between PMM & PO. Many different customer segment sets. PMM likes to do face time with PO to get to know what they have on their roadmap for next couple of weeks & get to know them; what it is looking like for them.

New PMMs do one on one with PO. Then each week full status update. asynchronous. PMM can give their update as meetings take most of the time. Face time is important. Meetings are recorded. SPrint reviews are recorded with high level takeaways. SO pMM can be up to date with PD.

Focus on relationship building first. Docs is there. 

Ongoing optimization. Getting PMM at the ideation or any thought . Meeting with Head of Product and then they pause and ask to get PMM for feedback. Get PMM to figure out if we can serve new customer or existing customer persona we are trying to cultivate.

Q: VAlidation of : how I have this idea & I wanna do X thing but make sure it serves Y customer. And push this

Who owns that decison? what cust. seg. should it focus on.

PM problem I've identified & need to solve BUT PMM this ist

Collab or NO or NO GO decision.

A: PM pain I see, issue I see

Validate with PMM Opportunities, Customer Segments & positioning. Then go to Head of Product. & Head of Marketing . Then they would need to come together.

Friend of Senior PM at IBM: No one knows about it, Keeping customers, Priced right. 

Ideation & validation for the idea and the business. Before it was develop & then hope PMM can market it right.

change features to serve existing customers with suggestions from PMM to PMs.

Language of Sales.

Q: PMM are embedded in Marketing teams. Is it better to allow a PMM per team?
A: Depending on the way product is structured. GetResponse, not one PMM is involved in one thing but learn all things but has to deal with only one channel at a time based on their team and their specific product.

She got insight at a junior level about this silo problem and then as she got leadership, she organized it into the workflow of training all PMMs in all products but focus on their respective assigned channel.

Conversion Rate optimization, user optimization, free accounts throughout the different channels.

PMM sits with Marketing Team. 

Q: Aspiring PMs. As they are starting out in the. Give us an idea at a tactical level in those weekly and biweekly meetings with PMs. i.e. from PMM to PM. 

A: First, sharing an agenda & documentation. 
Second, Invite then there will be a purpose & goal & topic for weekly convo. . 
Third, interesting easy to read agenda. Recap of Previous conversation. What did we say wee are goign to act out? Was it actioned? Anything outstanding from last meeting? 

Next steps:

Anything I learnt from last 2 weeks. From marketing & other POs. How would it align with their product?
Anything learnt from customers & cfteams.
Any idea?
Any opportunities they spotted to elevate their products & the revenue they are 

Structure for busy people: Docs., recapping, outstanding, knowledge from last week & what opportunities affect that particular POs.

What are you thinking on? What gets you excited?

Let them have the floor and share their ideas.

PMMs brought in earlier and be part of the validation phase. 

PMM for messaging, positioning ONLY and not validation is a mistake. 

Positioning briefs that many teams can use.

Need to finish: opportunies, strengths, who will be purchasing the product.

fwQ. Are positioning briefs a summary of the PRD?

Brief for content team.

Blog post for the SEO team for keyword marketing and research from where will we be competitive.

Is there anything left for next steps?

Bring all this to life in an app. Access to data. DNA Methylation Epigenetic biomarkers. Is your age rate accelerated/decelerrated? ML way intervention to reduce biological age.

Q: Big data and importance of data. Article on "Stop gorging on data".
A: Medium blog. Love of data. DAta education. Less interaction in workplace. What data do we actually need? 

Handed a task a data analyst, data scientist, PM and asked to work on it and find something out of it. Is that data actually required?

After a certain critical point, it will 

Age as a data point. not going to have a sticky solution and spur people away from your products.

Impact can expontially explode in your face.

Q: Tech debt and UX debt. and next is data debt?
A: dev team as a unit. diz dev. or sw dev. 

Debt has different values.

Sprint planning just a dev. task instead of sw, rnd or science tasks. 
irrelavent data. Plague of any corporate life.

Startups track something and then it is no longer relevant. 
Customers circumvent that and put in random data. So customers need to be told to enter accurate data.

Delicate balance between static dashboards or streaming data. but do you really need them? 

e.g. users stopping on onboarding video but is it really relevant or the user just curious and then stopping.

Q: approach to right way to track data?
A: depend on product.

Do reverse thinking. Instead of asking. I have all this data. Now what?

Instead ask: Are you trying to understand behaviour pattern or general trends? Then you can funnel down.

why? why do I care about this? why does the user care about this? why does the team care about this?

Use frameworks: Does it add value?

SWOT of investing time in this analysis. 

What am I getting out of this?

Is the data numerical? categorical? does it need a lot of cleaning? 

How do you want to frame it in the end?
Do you need a correlation?

Pitch team ideas to business to create a win. Join opportunity of pitching it and also getting rejected.

Are

Look back into framework. Are there opportunities? How old is it? Is it constantly coming in? Is it secured data? weak data? 

Do we need to make the system robust for this data?

I didn't realize all

Designing a data story. In the end, if you can't anymore. Avg. age of people in the fb group to qualify as leads. Then break it down into quartiles. Even though the average is 35, then median is completely different and then engaging audience is completely different.

 knowing why you want the data in the first place. Is it hypothesis or assumptions you want to validate? Metrics to track.
 
Need to story even if you have the best analysis.

It just doesn't fit with what 

Q: Inertia from PM pov. Pitch to the data team to invest time to clean up or organize data.
A: Data literacy & access. I should not be the only person with access to the data. Hack day.  

Looker to be on top of SQL. Organizes all this stuff into something abstract. Self-serving. Enables people to make their own decisions. PM workload won't be single point of ideas. When everyone has access and the literacy capability to understand it, then it is powerful & democratization. it stops data silo approach.

If no other way, then select tools & techniques. and come with biz. plan and show value.

If we do this then we will also have time for X. 

Breaking down the opportunity cost. If we don't do this. 

killing two brids. user literacy. Showing them the data pain.

Operations or sales and they are on the front line and will face pain. Start there: what do you wish you knew to make your life easier. i.e. they needs a list of call. or make a pipelline to get some data to that point.

Q: Aspiring PMs. Where can we go and

# Path 2 Product - Stakeholder Empathy - Never Assume Stakeholder Priorities - 20210225 - dvxti9PmFy8 - youtube [18 - 360x360 (360p)]

Never Assume Bonus Series.

Never Assume Stakeholder Priorities

Stakeholder management (hate that term.) most stakeholders are senior so we don't manage them.

Stakeholder alignment or empathy:

internal stakeholders in PM

internal stakeholders in xfn teams

external stakeholders in customer.

Build upon this advice. This was done in former job.

ishPM team - 3 questions on a quarterly basis. Improve effectiveness as a PM. Make a google form. dev lead, ux lead, qa lead, data lead, pmm lead, Boss etc.. These people are vital to success. Asking them same questions.

What should I start doing that I'm not doing?
What am I doing that I should stop doing? annoying or destructive or counter-productive that team wants to stop doing including soft skills, interpersonal stuff?
What should I be doing more of that would add value to the team I'm part of?

Follow up on these things. Don't ignore it. Follow up on the feedback. Changed behaviour.

If your dev lead is saying stop doing user research. 

mentormesh.io J. Taylor

ishXFN support functions - Prog. Manager in Google. She would ask core client: 

who are two people I should be talking to who are part of this project?

i_What are your goals? What are they trying to accomplish? Dept. goals? team goals? that I should be aware of as a PM if conflicts come up or if misalignments come up. More subtle. What are the things that they are trying to accomplish e.g. churn

ii_what are the biggest challenges to accomplishing their goals? e.g. customer success? What are their goals around churn & challenges around churn?

iii_What can I do to help? Strong personalities. Some people are subtle. 

Build credibility with xfn stakeholders.

External stakeholders - Customer and users.
i_ What are the priorities of
i_ What do you use most in our product? 
ii_ What do you not use at all?
iii_ What is the best part of the product?
iv_ What is the worst part of the product?
v_ What tools or processes do you have for your job that live outside our product?

What are doing to accomplish their job? Anyway everyone is doing similar things. copying competitors and implementing it on different things.

e.g. If they do their tasks without doing 

JTBD framework. b2b. They are hiring your product to do a job for them to accomplish their job.

External stakeholders and customers. 

Assuming.

Questions to ask instead of priorities.


# Path 2 Product - Validating Solutions at Scale wâ§¸ Microsoft PM, Felix Watson Jr. - 20210317 - DzD2USToYiU - youtube [18 - 640x360 (360p)]

"Validating Solutions at Scale"

Felix Watson Jr.

PM in Azure. BSCS for 4-5 years. Working on Giant network switches. Infrastructure of the country. 2013-2014. Brazil. Asking about questions: MBA by UCLA.

MS as PM in Dynamics, HR, marketing, sales app. Built AI & analytics features across these suites.

End to end . Highly technical support engineers. Built tools for customer facing and internal facing.

Q: In retrospect, advice for sw engineers. things to be aware of the transition.
A: In sw, it is easy to find ways to build or demo. skills. related to PM.

Team was having challenges about test automation and finding source of bugs. Took code over from old team and have legacy. Build automated testing suite in legacy code as it was prsent only in new code.

Convincing 2 more engineers. Found out use cases for the testing suite software. 

We reduced defect resolution time by about 30%. So as PM identifying a problem, knowing who your customers are, ideation, planning, executing, Measure business impact. Influence without authority.

Study the job descriptions and demo those skills and ask manager to help study and bring to life. 

Q: Engineers are far from customers. How important is it for engineer team to understand customer?
A: Engineers are interested in varying degrees. Open invite. Not all are interested. As part of PM job, bring energy. Bring energy by empathy. Let customer bring out their pain points.

My job as PM is not to give ideas, it is to explain exactly what the problem is. Clarity to what problem we are solving. Bringing engineers closer to customer pain. They are close to the code and tech.

As PM, Owning discovery piece and making sure that we are solving the right problem BUT on the solution space, we have to work with the team.

Q: validating solutions at scale. Focus on Discovery. Is there a high level approach or framework to validate solutions with customers? What does that validatio process like?
A:  validate a solution at scale. We do a lot of things that don't seem scalable.

We get best insights from qualitative research. Double check those hypostheiss with datat BUT solution validation as Quickly and cheaply as possible in front of customers.

In MS, private preview. Pilot customer, insights and feedback as we are going. 

Prototyping, design mocks in Figma. Advanced as clickthrough simulation. 5-10 customers. Anotehr way to validate.

Another research tool, evaluate. tools like 'usertesting'. unmoderated study for 30-40 people.  Have a researcher and going through 

Q: Which customer 
A: representative of the set that we have. Biggest customer. Spread.

In HR space, we built a tool for recruiters. Big customers for early feedback.
In marketing automation space, validating in user space. Usertesting. Worked with a researcher to build a screener to get to known the company, size of the company, details etc... 

Q: Various Types of companies use MS. For being specific, predominant industry solving need. or get CRoss section of companies to scale up only the important things.
A: MS didn't do industry specific stuff. MS built a platform and used partners to do industry specific stuff.

Differing approaches. Some companies specialised and specific approach.

Q:Risks involved in evaluating for scaling from a qualitative point of view?
A: Biggest failure stories. In HR space, didn't do the good job of getting representative sample. 

Majority of customer was on large end. 

Much more impact sooner simpler solution was also tested on smaller customers and built up to server larger customers.

Short & fast prioritization techniques. Large customers purchased the dashboard solutions.

Q: Measuring quantitative success. How to blend qualitative with large customers?
A: I talk to largest customers. larger customers are smaller in number and hence is .

Failure: We launched a feature to larger customers and they liked it and got more customers as a result but the adoption metrics was bad (less than 10%). 

Thinking about how to solve problems of sales team to make more sales instead of lookign at how to increase adoption rate.

Failing in sales because this features is not there.

a>Need to know what the baseline is.
b>How are we measuring success? engagement, satisfaction, sales problem is not a user problem,
c>Intentional about solving customer problem. Did I actually solve the customer problem?
d>Define in the beginning, what numbers you need to be looking at, how to get the data and do the quantitative data in the end.

Solving customer problems vs. sales team problem.

Q: For Aspiring PMs, what is the good first step to get started?
A: depends on company, resources.

quantitative data tells you what?
qualitative data tells you why?

i_user research resource: 
"this is what problem i'm trying to discover?" should I use survey, focus group etc...

ii_CustomerProgram: Really make sure you have a good way to get in touch with the customers. Find customers to guide roadmap, new features. BUIld a customer program. Going through the sales team. Avoid sales team.

iii>tool liike 'usertesting' tool to do and manage research.

Be scrappy. "would you mind talking to me for 30min?"
Do whatever you can to start to talk to customers?
first do the unscalable way and then do it on scale.

Customer Support: Big opportunities.

A: for PMs, customer conversations: user research, discovery.
internal facing conversations: 3 major

A: If manager is avoiding questions around performance conversations.

Annual performance review. Managers keep feedback from employees until the very end. 

or they keep until the end about mistakes.

Boss said why don't you sit down and rewrite your job description. 

Better way to approach that question as an employee is own what my expectations are: Have a say in that and direct that.

Your manager is overworked so he cannot answer you about your role & responsibilities & expectations. 

Do it is to own your workflow. Taking time to answer 3 key questions. LIstening Tour: 3 questions. Executives talk to stakeholders. PM: what is my performance based on? What is expected of me? How can I balance these expectations as I have a lot of stakeholders?

eng, lead, partner, sales, boss:

going back to manager and show that document and say this is how I'm benchmarking myself for success so that I deliver value for you. Do you have any inputs? 

They may object saying that the most important metric is this and not that. Let's talk with the other person who said that. "i don't care, I want this". Talk about it.

This process of listening to stakeholders. I'm trying to add value in this document.

Q: things to look for in a resume.
A: Ideally when someone sees your resume, it should not be the first time they met you. Ideally you should have met or communicated or referred by someone known through email or cover letter.

Resume says I want a job

 Q: 
 A: Arts background --> Graphic Dsign world --> UX & product design --> UX to product mangement.
 
 Scale up to big publisher. Innovation lab to build parallel products. PM leading a scrum team to make apps.
 
Running their mobile apps. Product lead of PM team & Mobile App team.
 
B2B Stealth startup - First b2b experience on the food waste sustainability market.
  
UX Skills overlap - Product discovery into product delivery. 2000s it was devs to PMs. Now in 2010s it is UX to PMs.

PM needs to understand the other parts. Tech knowledge & business knowledge. Need to know the ballpark ranges of possibilities. Business needs. Founders say "we need to move the needle in the next few months."

Most important thing: Am I going to make a product that will be used? Engagement generates revenue but revenue doesn't generate engagement.

When I think of feature or product --> What problem am I solving? --> How will they experience the solution?

Q: b2b vs. b2c. What are the main differences?
A: Restaurants were a business but were almost b2c as no single restaurant is too important to drive the roadmap changes. Suppliers were fewer but bigger in influence. If a supplier with 20% of your volume, money spent, revenue it has more clout. That is the biggest difference. In b2c, rare for a specific request form a specific customer asking for a . In b2b, it can happen.

More B2B have PMMs than B2C.

In enterprise customers also moving downsteam. consumerization and PLG as time goes on. 

If you really have a b2b product and your customers are huge then they are more than capable of rolling out a solution. So you have to widen the net.

Q: An article. What was the driver behind it and document thoughts around what truly makes a great prodcut?
A: Situation was in an interview. Completely blanked out on a question. Can you speak about a product that you like and why you like it?

I would not be able to explain why I liked it. It's not over till its over.

SIte and down and think "what makes a product excel?" article.

Q: 1.Clear value proposition? Should PM or PMM determine valueprop. or what ownership?

A:
Ownership is shared between PMM and PM. So PMM was closer to user. Neither the PMM or PM own the valueprop. 

User uses it for something different. Shared ownership but valueprop.

It's not us. We don't determine what it is, we may try to make it fit because we have this idea of valueprop. in our head but really it is driven by customer. If the customer.

It applies in UX. Users use the product in hacky ways. Not as intended but maybe it is normal for them. Better to solve their flow than to make them use it in the right way.

Q: 2.Simplicity: usuability testing is a good tool. Valuable skillset for a PM. 
A: User testing, user interview and user. NOt a hard requirement.

If users don't understang your product, it is your fault.

Q: 3.Habit formation
A: talk by "heirarchy of engagement" ~ sarah. ~ 
i_sustainable growth
ii_habit formation - acrueing benefits and mounting losses. Basically, every use of a product make it better and makes it difficult to give up. e.g. Productivity App.  
iii_virtuous loops

Q:4.Personalisation and ML
A: In my expreience, huge company with b2c and amazing with ML scientists especially in the area of fashion. 

Don't need to do particular/specific personalisation as Spotify. Most popular items doesn't need ML.

e.g. A group of customers bought a certain items. and create upsells or cross-sells. Coupons for depts.
Cross polinixation - Spotify can sell headphones. Smaller products can moentize through 3rd party sellers.

Q: Most of it will be ordered by customers. b2b. user research on 
A: Past b2n experience says difficult to do user testing. b2b customers know they have clout. e.g. in two-sided experience. What benefits one doesn't benefit with others. 

Laundry list of feature requests: Not ideal. Important to listen to customers but as PM needs to look into this and figure out what exactly they want. 

They are giving the solution but they are not their giving the problem.

Pushback, they want X but Y can already solve it with a better experience.

2cents: Getting down to the root problem helps with prioritization of the items. 350 customers. Do the problem that serves the larger chunk of customers.

Conflict around one feature to close more deals. Segmentation data. Solving this problem would impact this % of customers. HIPPO Problem.

Q: 
A: reframe things. reframing situation and problems is important in PM.

# Path 2 Product - Priced to Scale feat. Ajit Ghuman, Head of Product Marketing @ Narvar - 20210423 - 0R6u1qEnaQ0 - youtube [18 - 640x360 (360p)]

Priced to Scale 

Secret of pricing strategy from startups to marketing...

Q: Intro?
A: Ajit. Day job: Product Marketing. Narvar. In SV in 12 years. This is 5th startup. Mostly in the CRM and customer experience space.

Q: Have they all been saas based companies? pricing?
A: Everyone said pricing is complicated. Pricing is actually not.

Q: Back story of your hypothesis.
A: demand for consultants for pricing. They charge quite a lot of money. Orgs. throw their hands up sometimes and say they don't know how to deal with it.

Orgs. know the customers and pricing. It starts from positioning.

Wolf of Wall Street - Pricing is based on the value that exists in the buyer's mind and everythign we do in M and PM we do to establish the value in the mind. 

Perceiving the value.

Orgs. to be confident. When companies outsource this important function, a lot of skill and value get lost.

Q: In PMM term is user. Pricing Promotion & Place is the standard academic Marketing Mix. Where is the overlap in PMM & PM in uncovering pricing?
A: 
Overlap is in Strategy & Positioning & Packaging:

why building the product?
what problem are we trying to solve?

i_Positioning: why solving it and how doing it better than the competitors.
This is how we are going to deliver value.
ii_Packaging: is essentially naming. X product is for healthcare, then build for healthcare package. 

Handoff period between PM & PMM.

Three pronged framework:

name, priciing, which segment are we targeting & deliver value.

Nice cadence between Pm & PMM is helpful in getting the most bang for the buck.

Q: Value perceived from the customer is in line "what is the job they are hiring your product"
A: Packaging: map features to use cases. similar to jtbd.
Use that to see what set of features to solve this particular problem that is tied to a particular value.

I can see based on the package that you are going to solve 4 of my main problems. Exactly that jtbd & use case example.

Competitor: Wee are more rich fetaure set than other competitors. Makes sense only in the case that you are next best competitor to the leading brand. 

Most case there is prod. differentiation. If you don't have product differentiation, then that is a worrying factor. Make sure there is product differentiation. PM's job. 

There will always a difference between a competitor's customer segment than yours. What the customer is looking in others vs. your product.

So it is not even the price point. Before the price point, pricing metric, pricing structure. Different company stage. Growing companies have linear pricing to offload the risk from the customers (small company may close down and put risk on customers. that is why.).

In rare cases, when only thing left is similar markets, .... competitive pricing is the last stand.

Strategy to pricing:- "revenue collective". Competition lowering pricing is a trap. Tom Tungus VC. Blogs on the topic. Enterprises will value your product if your price is higher. In their domain, avg. price is higher.

Q: Book on pricing. Impetus on writing the book. & value for reader. "Price to Scale" ebok.
A: Effort of trying to find.

9 pricing experts in the valley. Their case studies is also included. 

Follow steps to make a pricing decision: 10 cases. MBA pricing conjoint analysis. clickbaity type blogs.

Q: You worked in startup environement. What are the different pricing concerns in startup worlds vs. enterprises?
A: startup is gun shy as they are small. startups do pay as you use.

As they grow, they want more revenue stability. So it is a fixed minimum monthly pay.

SKUs increase and as they become post IPO company. complexity has increased. So they have to reduce the pricing categories as the overall revenue.

Duality between less complexity and more complexity. Push and pull dynamic between simple and complex pricing models.

Going from PM to CEO featuring Rich Sanchez

Q: Welcome back! 2nd guest. 
A: been in PM for 10 years.

skills 

VC: acquiring tech biz. and make them and sell them at a higher level.

Q: PM skills transferred to private equity.
A: Core skills of PM: communicators. Shape vision. Shape direction of a company of a product and do it with different languages. design, tech, biz.

private equity is the language of finance. Completely different from I was used to. debt, assets, convertible notes. Founder is raising money. How to take people's money and share with founding team.

Ability to learn as a PM helped a lot in private equity.

2nd_Communication is how the world works especially in terms of private equity. Raise $60 Million fund.
Explain what will be the returns. Being able to model it out in real-time. That gets the investors excited. As opposed to talking it out or just doing a pitch deck. 

3rd_

Q: prototypes or video demos. But for investors, models are the prototypes ofr 
A: Different investors has different risk tolerance. 100X returns. Other investors want max. upside but lower returns but higher than snp. Understanding invesotrs and adjust variables or adjust on the fly help partners raise in roughly 4 months.

Q: In pe & vc, the risk game of investment. 9 of 10 failures. PMs will also face the similar risk. 90% of features may not not be a hit. Transferable skill. Being okay with experimentation and risk and failure.
A: Some investors idea of failure is different from PMs. Other people's money. Due diligence. He likes to incubate ideas or case studies with low bets. i.e. A/B testing or validation through incubators and show investors that this works and can make a lot of money. we run this, do this on a large scale.

In product dev. In Disney, throttle traffic and did it on a subset and see the response.


Incubation. So that investors will get higher returns.

Validation. testing. prototyping. MVPs.



Q: Learning new languagess. If transitioning to industries, different domain. How to learn new language?
A: diving in at a faster pace. Going on a learning expedition. Taking courses, reading, watching videos. Download all to learn and as concentrated as possible.

BUT all level of application that has to happen. Say the work and teach to others. Explain it to mom and others complex concepts. 

Diving in, learning and doing something with it.

Everyone has to onboard. Accelerate the learning process. Data acquistion is faster in the curious phase/stage.

Q: Anything else that sticks out as transferable skills. Skills to successfully launch their own thing.
A: Communication.
important skill for PM
Ability to lead: understanding team effort vs. individual effort. Jumping into PE is natural learning into.

Q: take a step back. Is PE a future for PMs? 
A:
VC: early stage startups. great founders. no revenue yet but great team, great ideas. Enough runway to see that through. Then that vc or angel will see the returns.
PE: biz. model is looking after existing biz. good track record at least 3 years running, established growth company. company has been around. PE will acquire that biz. Improve by bringing in new CEO, person, new team. Then doing IPO or another way.

Effectively own a multimillion dollar company on day 1 of acquisition.

VC: multimillion dollars can get lost in a startups.

PM can be great at being as operators. Managing people, tech etc... Can I be the CEO of a new company that just needs direction. You could be a CEO of a new company or bring on the developers, marketeers, designers etc... 


He started off as being a CEO of an existing company. Existing PM as pool of operators to manage existing companies.

Risk tolerance is lower than starting a business. i.e. being an operator of one of our portfolio companies. i.e. core skill sets are there.

acquisitions as a means of being a new entrepreneur. Baby boomer retiring. Operator biz. or take them to the next level.

True passion for that space.

Politicians and govt. officials should go through the PM skillset.

Q: Better leader. What would that look like?
A: leadership is the ability to act as you want your team to act.

Fitness analogy: go with them instead of just giving directions. Sense of purpose. Understand what people are going through but also be able to do the work. 

Managers hire smarter people. Love to work with leaders that know the industry and know the space. Not a one-sided team. It's all for now.

Sports: 

Q: Getting into PE Space.
A: Be operators. It is a game that understanding the biz. that you are going after and knowing that you have the edge or have something that you can go after

 
# Path 2 Product - Following Through on Success Metrics wâ§¸ Lance Douglas, Product Manager @ Vitruvi - 20210513 - osgOoQPVdnM - youtube [18 - 640x360 (360p)]

Following Through on Success Metrics wâ§¸ Lance Douglas, Product Manager @ Vitruvi

Measuring success & following through.

Q:
A: b2b saas. tackling digitial transformation. Fresh and up to date on tech stuff. 

Trying the bst wasy to merge product mindset. Helping dev teams.

Q: We build stuff. Escaping the build trap. Advice to PL to make change around the value of measuring success.
A: If you are not following through on your success metrics, if you build and don't measure then you lose sight of what/why your customers. Difficult to keep a pulse on that.

saas customers buy, adopt, referral. If you don't hit the value you believe that they were selecting you for. You were the bset at that time. Your pitch was good but when the competition realises.

Q: look for competition about what to build and not looking at the customer. Take the time to do qualitative insight & validating it. Stealing from competition.
A: Share your idea. Lot more than just following through the features. Anyone can copy Tesla. Not about that. KNowing about customer and how those features drive values for customers & moat you have dug around yoursellf and the customer.

What levers you can pull around value with custoemrs.

Q: Follow through. Establish a success metric and follow through. Holding themselves accountable.

A: easy to identify org. that is feature factory. 2X2.

Ask a company how their product roles are managed. Might be aligned. If eng. team doesn't know what product roles. What are customer metrics to follow up on?

IN eng. env.... Acceptence criteria should be behavioural change.

This is what we are releasing... this is what we are hoping to find out.

When we are success vs. failure. What is the standard deviation for that?

>> In following up, is it simply --> we got metrics --> we got customers to do xyz --> or less fall off or people moved from activation to refferal. 15%. What if we got 25%?

What didn't we know????? 10X.

Mantras: outputs over outcomes. Beauty in showing/sharing how your work maps to the overall goal. Empowers pm, ux, dev...

Devs are closer to tech. 


Q: Ripple effects or tangible negative from overshooting?
A: Disney+ overshot. 20M the first year. 80M actual.

startup & customer-centric. They might not know what drew them , where those customeres were leaving? what wallet was switched? 

By overshooting, we don't know where they will go. They hvae a higher bar but don't know how to sustain.

recommendation systems was set for 20M but now we have 80M. 

Marketing 101: everything you say will be challenged. you can go out of buziness if you have too many customers.

People doomed by their own success. Video conferencing companies broke down during pandemic.

If you don't budgets for 2X to 4X. If you can't get accounting for these high overbudgets.

overshooting within standard deviation.

overperforming or underperforming is okay as long as you know how it got there.

>> What were you expecting and when something doesn't happen, how  are you going to measure that.  so you know to predict better.

Inside knowledge jof unknowns unknowns. so that you know how things unfolded.


Q: Follow Through. Accountability responsible? lack of accountability? not holding people accountable? no success metrics?
A: Cultural challenges in PM. Biggest challenge - people don't know and don't have a reason to.

OKRs, smartboard that leaders are mandating .


If we don't have metrics to answer to. 

Both sides: No measurement. Just keep building...
Other side. Very measurement oriented. level of experimentation needs.

baseline of performance success.


It takes too many time and gets in the way of activity. Hypothesis 15min. e.g. We think customer needs this feature X, we don't have any evidence except gut feeling. We think this is where it is going to hit. OK. Go build it!!!

May take a year to get a culture in place.

May be of value but really it is not. You are just burning cash.

Q: Measure success before we actually start something? rules of thumb or heuristics?
A: "It depends". What works your org., culture & what's being driven?

rubrik. Metrics that I'm capturing, how it is being calculated into value, alarms, etc...

JTBD - 

KANO model - how do customers perceive?

overdelivering/underdelivering.

Model known/knowns, unknown/unknowns etc...

15 different tools.

Blue Ocean strategy map.

SWOT --> TOWELS --> Large ocean picture... How market looks. Allows people to see the hypothesis.

Q: strategy to goals to missions. no hard or fast metric. What metrics allow you to reach the goal the mission?

# Path 2 Product - Creating Stakeholder Alignment with JTBD wâ§¸ Bob Moesta - President and CEO of The Rewired Group - 20210514 - G90XqrXVwcc - youtube [18 - 360x360 (360p)]


Creating Stakeholder Alignment with JTBD wâ§¸ Bob Moesta

Align the organization around the progress our customers are trying to make. JTBD that they hire our product for.

Rewired Group.



Q: JTBD
A: JTBD

Q: jtbd in pm but also other parts of the org. What are the other parts of jtbd?
A: "Demand side sales" is using jtbd around sales part of organisations focus people buy as opposed to us forcing them to put.

Flipping the lens on employments. jtbd - are you making progress around your career.

Also project around 4 years in religion.

Q: 
A: Nothing is random, everything is casual. What job is everyone hiring my product for?

Q: What is the origin story of jtbd?
A: All problems are problems of variations. A thing that varies one things varies another thing.

Taguchi to solve this is to understand how to find right measures and functions of something. As engineers, we are taught more about problems than about functions. What job does this system do? What function does this system fulfill?

What function does the customer want? What job does the customer have that pulls our system in? what progress they want to make?

Q: As PM concept of personas. Marketing personas around gender, age etc... 
A: In PM personas take on a different tone.

Marketing research - demographics, psychographics & personas.

As an engineer, how is this fun? 

Context creates value for people. 

who when where and why determines the job.

Pricing comes from positioning. i.e. how you position your product to do the job?

Q: how to from job/user interviews to better collaborate with our PMM counterparts?
A: 



context adds as much value as the product.
product in wrong context, people won't pay anything for it.

Product is about context. i_Positioning for the consumer to know that it will do their job.
Pricing wrong as you tend to average everything.


Willing to pay more to make progress. 

Value code of people to what they willing to pay more for or not?

value prop to determine price.


Feature creep - supply side. - people don't understand most of the features.
demand side. - 

we assuem our competitors have done by their job.


What competes with a new mattress is not another new matress but a bottle of zequay.

They compete. Snickers people don't think of Milky Way when buying or eating Snickers.


Q: Does PMM connect with sales>
A: Flip the sales funnel. Lead but don't know where they are in the buying process. Why are people buying this?

Buying = first thought, passively looking, active looking, deciding, first use. Marketing role is something they need .

Sales role: passive looking to active looking to deciding.
Demo at passive looking, Demo at active looking, Demo as deciding to make trade-offs.

3 demos based on the buying timeline.

Q: Demo. model vs. free trial model
A: Industry or context specific.

download is passive looking. Right notion of how people convert. Once they buy, how do they fit the product in their lives.

What are they struggling with even when they are using your product?

Not a big proponent of free trial. They don't know how much time they have to invest.

Q: Person involved in the education cycle??
A: how do you make progress in your career? in panic mode.

Where are the moments when people are taking a step back to be able to think about having a mindspace.

Progress that employee wants to make vs. I want to make from them. We don't know. Build a way to get better.

Q: Quantitative goals vs. seeing progress.
A: Emotional and social progress is important to be seen or noticed.

break it down and what to learn, try, make mistakes.... over 90 days look for opportuniteis, 

hard part is planning is rooted from the financial world. Finance needs predictable. Innovation or PD is about unknowns. So spend more time on unknowns and make it knowns.

Q: Leading by influence. Jtbd advice around making influences?
A: in every discussion, "forces of progress". What does progress look like for John? Conversation stays on the playing field. 

People hard time to align to jtbd. Don't talk abotu the job. Talk about the customer.

In board meeting, what jobs does board want to be done?

leads aren't lead tobuy but to explore.

helping goals but shaping their direction into two/three pieces.

2nd part is systems. inputs --> actions --> output.

e.g. is trust an input or an output? We need trust but we have to cause it i.e. cause trust. Understand the casual mechanism of what makes it work.

e.g. Telecom services and considereing switching services. What did the other ones not do that you didn't trust them?

Playing field: they knew when to say no because they knew what they could/couldn't do. They were empowered to do the right decision.

Notion here is to understand your counterparts: What progress is Marketing trying to make? what are they driving for? what are they afraid of? What are they willing ot take a risk on?

what is their risk? Where is the right compromise between the two of us so that we both make progress?

going to the bottom to understand what they want.


Q: teaching empathatic understanding.
A: where is the gap? what are they not believing? It was a language issue and then it was 80%.

fav. thing is to coach a lot and then

Q: Why do people fail to follow up? Is it a fear?
A: comes down to emphatetic understanding.

When you ask the question? 
"What did you hear from me?" sounds arrogant.

I;m a little confused, help me understand what. 

Practicing delivery of that communication.

Hate transcripts.

how they say it. 

2 type of problems: dictionary problem: same words, meaning is different. Thesaurus problem: different words, same meaning.

digging deeper into what people mean, into what they are asking.

tweet. 
Q.How do I handle stakeholder feedback? manage priorities when 

properly/precisely define the problem to come up with concrete solutions.

Scenario: Internal products for internal stakeholders.

Recency Bias - e.g. talk to marketing about market. Any stakeholder group who priority keeps changes. STOP. Go back to first principles. "what is the goal?" "why was I hired to build the product?"

What is the outcome that you are driving towards? If you can't precisely define the outcome or the goal. Tricky part of PM. 

Really dig deep on the problem. When do they experience the pain? what are they doing today? existing solutions? 

PRIOritize based on which create immediate value based.

incremental adding value over time and getting closer to the outcome that we want.
 
Taking one year to get value.

If we are talking about internal feedback for products that are sold to external users or customers.

Sales, marketing, customer success, & executive will give internal feedback. Getting buy-in because they are getting heard.

Talking to customers is a huge input. 

"Oh.Ok. this must have changed." and recency bias and we keep changing things.

Take all inputs and synthesize them towards a goal and desired outcome, behaviour trying to change & how to prioritize prblems against that goal. 

Foundational. impact & value in the market.

Company will just turn into a feature factory.
desirability, usuabilty, viability

Preceisly defining the problem against the goal that you are trying to reach as a company.

"why did I lose this customer?" Don't take direct dmends or orders from executive. Create yoru own case using quant. and qual. data to show reasons.
